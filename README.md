Mono: Embeddable Terminal Emulator
----------------------------------

**Mono** is a terminal emulator that can be embedded in tkinter applications. See [examples](./examples) for demo. The codebase was extracted from the [**Biscuit project**](https://github.com/billyeatcookies/biscuit) and published as an embeddable widget library.

* Supports handling **multiple instances** of terminals of different shells running simultaneously.
* Comes as a standalone terminal widget & a **tabbed widget** as well, for handling different terminal instances.
* **Custom shells** can be added; terminals can be set to be launched from any directory.
* Themes are customizable by user.
